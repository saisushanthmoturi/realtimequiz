# Quiz Page Error Fix - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Issue Fixed:
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` in `src/app/quiz/page.tsx`

## Root Cause:
The quiz page was trying to render `currentQ.options.map()` for all question types, but `options` is `undefined` for `true_false` and `short_answer` questions.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Updated Question Interface üîß
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  topic: string;
  type: 'mcq' | 'true_false' | 'short_answer';
  question: string;
  options?: string[];  // Made optional
  difficulty: string;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Answer Handling üìù
- Updated answers state to support both strings and numbers
- Created `handleTextAnswerChange` for short answer questions
- Added `isQuestionAnswered` helper for different question types

### 3. Conditional Question Rendering üé®
Added proper conditional rendering for all three question types:

**MCQ Questions:**
- Radio buttons with all options
- Highlights selected choice

**True/False Questions:**
- Radio buttons for "True" and "False"
- Clean, simple interface

**Short Answer Questions:**
- Text area for written responses
- Character validation for meaningful answers

### 4. Improved UI Elements ‚ú®
