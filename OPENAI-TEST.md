# Test Real OpenAI Integration

If you have an OpenAI API key, you can test the real AI question generation:

## Step 1: Add API Key
Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

## Step 2: Test AI Generation
```bash
# Create a new quiz
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/quiz \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "OpenAI Test",
    "topic": "Artificial Intelligence",
    "questionCount": 3,
    "type": "live", 
    "timeLimit": 300,
    "createdBy": "TEACHER001"
  }'

# Start the quiz (replace ID with actual quiz ID from response)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/quiz/{QUIZ_ID}/start

# Join as student (replace SESSION_CODE with actual code)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/quiz/join \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionCode": "SESSION_CODE",
    "studentId": "AI_TEST_001"  
  }'
```

## Expected Result with OpenAI API
- Questions will be dynamically generated by GPT-3.5-turbo
- More diverse and creative questions based on the topic
- Better contextual explanations
- Higher quality educational content

## Verification
Check the server logs - you should see:
- ✅ "Generating questions using OpenAI API..." instead of "No OpenAI API key found, using fallback questions"
- ✅ More varied and sophisticated question content
- ✅ Topic-specific questions that go beyond the fallback templates

The system gracefully handles both scenarios:
- **With API Key**: Real AI-generated questions
- **Without API Key**: High-quality fallback questions

Both modes provide excellent educational experiences!
