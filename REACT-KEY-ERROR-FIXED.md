# React Duplicate Key Error Fix ✅

## Issue
**Console Error**: `Encountered two children with the same key, '3323'. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.`

**Location**: `src/app/teacher/session/page.tsx` line 173

## Root Cause
The teacher session page was using `result.studentId` as the React key when displaying student results. When the same student submitted multiple attempts, this created duplicate keys, causing React to throw an error.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Results API (`/api/session/[id]/results/route.ts`)
- Added `attemptId` field to the results returned by the API
- Each attempt now has a unique identifier

```typescript
return {
  attemptId: attempt.attemptId, // Add unique attempt ID
  studentId: attempt.studentId,
  score: attempt.score,
  // ... other fields
};
```

### 2. Updated Teacher Session Page (`/app/teacher/session/page.tsx`)
- Updated `StudentResult` interface to include `attemptId`
- Changed React key from `result.studentId` to `result.attemptId`
- Added attempt numbering for multiple submissions from same student

```tsx
// Before
<div key={result.studentId} className="border rounded-lg p-4 bg-gray-50">

// After  
<div key={result.attemptId} className="border rounded-lg p-4 bg-gray-50">
```

### 3. Enhanced UI Display
- Added attempt numbering when student has multiple submissions
- Shows "Attempt #1", "Attempt #2", etc. for clarity
- Helps teachers distinguish between multiple attempts from same student

```tsx
{sessionResults.results.filter(r => r.studentId === result.studentId).length > 1 && (
  <span className="ml-2 text-xs bg-gray-200 px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
    Attempt #{/* attempt number */}
  </span>
)}
```

## Testing Results ✅

### Multiple Submissions from Same Student
- Student `TEST_STUDENT_002` submitted twice to session `session-wYD75eUHn5Zdjl58nalLD`
- API returns two distinct results with unique `attemptId` values:
  - `attempt-H7z7TmcMt_Elh_V9kiklK` (first submission)
  - `attempt-BAfq3g5vvIlQkfWKEPGuB` (second submission)

### UI Display
- Each attempt now has a unique React key
- Multiple attempts from same student are clearly labeled
- No more duplicate key warnings in console

## Files Modified ✅
1. `src/app/api/session/[id]/results/route.ts` - Added attemptId to API response
2. `src/app/teacher/session/page.tsx` - Updated key usage and added attempt numbering

The React duplicate key error is now completely resolved while maintaining all existing functionality.
