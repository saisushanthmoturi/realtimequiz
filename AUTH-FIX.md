# Real-Time Quiz Authentication Fix

## Issue Fixed
The authentication system was failing due to a Next.js architecture conflict between client and server components. The error occurred because:

1. The MongoDB connection code was declared with `'use client'` directive 
2. The API routes are server components
3. Next.js prevents using client code from server components

## Solution
We implemented a complete separation of client and server authentication:

1. Created a dedicated server-side authentication service (`server-auth.ts`)
2. Updated the login and register API routes to use this server-compatible service
3. Added detailed logging to help with troubleshooting
4. Preserved all business logic for different auth flows (teacher vs student)

## Testing the Fix
